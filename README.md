 VBA Challenge (Stock Data)

Title & Description of the Challenge
This challenge is part of module 2 and assesses our skills & knowledge about coding in VBA. 

About the challenge:
We have been provided with a stock dataset containing stock open, close, high, low and total stock volume values along with the ticker.
In this challenge I have done the coding (using ws.) such that my code can run on all the provided sheets simultaneously 
I have assignmed and initialized variables as required.
I have made use of the "if" and "if else" conditions in the code wherever required to fulfil a certain condition 
I have used the "next" function with a conditional <> (not equal to) to fetch and output the desired ticker values.
Conditions have also been used to apply the % and $ symbol in the required columns
Colour coding has been done making use of the "if else" conditional for positive and negative values

Key Findings:
THB had the greatest percentage increase in year 2018,  RYU for 2019 & YDI for year 2020 respectively.
RKS had the greatest percentage decrease in both years 2018 and 2019. For both the years the values did not vary sigificantly though.
QKN had the greatest total stock volume in years 2018 and 2020 while in the year 2019 ZQD had the greatest total volume.
